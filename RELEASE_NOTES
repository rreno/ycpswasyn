R3.0.4: 2018-11-08 J. Vasquez
    * build against:
      - cpsw/framework -> R3.6.6, which implies:
        - boost -> 1.64.0
        - yaml-cpp -> yaml-cpp-0.5.3_boost-1.64.0
      - asyn -> R4.31.0-0.1.0, 
      - yamlLoader -> R1.1.2

R3.0.3: 2018-10-29 K. Kim
    * build against cpsw/framework R3.6.6
                    asyn R4.31.0-0.1.0
                    yamlLoader R1.1.1

R3.0.2: 2018-07-18 K. Kim
    * build against asyn/R4.32-1.0.0

R3.0.1: 2018-06-13 J. Vasquez
    * Add ":" between "$(P)" and "$(R)" macros on the templates use 
      with dictionarie (named "Register*.templates"), in order to be 
      backward compatible with previous versions.
    * Do not call exit() if sched_setscheduler or mlockall fail. 
      This will allow IOC to run even if the user do not have the right
      privileges.

R3.0.0: 2018-04-23 J. Vasquez
    * Added a new mode of autogeneration of PVs using SHA1 hash
      as PV names. Now YCPSWASYNConfig accepts an mode arguments
      (1: PV names using maps as before, 2: using new hashed names).
      See README.autoPVGeneration for more information.
    * The signature of YCPSWASYNConfig changed in order to have fewer
      parameters (See README.configureDriver for more information): 
      - It doesn't accept anymore a YAML file and IP address.
        The yamlLoader module must be used instead.
      - The PV name max lenght was a default value of 60, and it can
        be changed using the function "YCPSWASYNSetPvMaxNameLen".
      - The default SCAN value has a default value of "Passive", and
        it can be changed using the function "YCPSWASYNSetDefaultScan".
    * A new function can be used to select the location of the mapping
      files: "YCPSWASYNSetMapFilePath". The default location is "yaml/".
    * A new function can be used to select the destination of the debug
      information files: "YCPSWASYNSetDebugFilePath". The default
      location is "/tmp/".
    * The PV name prefix can now be empty, in this case ":" is not
      addedd to the PV names.
    * Bug fixed when computing bit-size.
    * Improve debug inforamtion style.
    * Code clean up and refactored.

R2.0.3: 2018-03-22 K. Kim
    * bumpup cpsw/framework R3.6.3
    * bumpup yamlLoader     R1.1.0

R2.0.2: 2018-02-15 J. Vasquez
    * Improve performace of the stream handling setting its thread
      as a RT task, and erasing only the part of the buffer that was
      not updated.

R2.0.1: 2018-01-22 J. Vasquez
    * Update ASYN to version R4.31-0.1.0.

R2.0.0: 2017-11-14 J. Vasquez
    * Change save/load default PV to waveforms so they can
      hold longer paths respect to string PVs. With this
      change a defult configuration file can not longer be
      defined as a macro in st.cmd.
    * Add the CPSW root path for save/load configurations.
    * Add subArrays to the stream waveform PVs for easier
      visualization in GUIs.
    * Handle error when saving/loading configurations and
      print number of entries saved/loaded.
    * Verify if entries were actually saved/loaded.
    * Minor code clean up.

R1.1.6: 2017-05-03 J. Vasquez
    * Update to CPSW framework R3.5.4
    * Update to yamlLoader R1.0.3
    * Minor bug fixes

R1.1.5: 2017-04-27 J. Vasquez
    * Fix lookup function for stream interfaces

R1.1.4: 2017-04-05 J. Vasquez
    * Added support for using the yamlLoader module

R1.1.3: 2017-04-05 J. Vasquez
    * Remove Display and Restore sources

R1.1.2: 2017-03-29 J. Vasquez
    * Bug fixed on stream thread handler that was causing random
      segmentation faults.
    * Fixed some memory leaks.
    * Minor improvements to code.

R1.1.1: 2017-03-16 J. Vasquez
    * First stable tag for EPICS base 3.15.
    * This version includes the autogeneraton of PVs as well as the
      possibility to manually generate PVs for selected registers.

R1.0.0: 2017-03-16 J. Vasquez
    * First stable release version
